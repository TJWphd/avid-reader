Thanks to John Young, Zac Warner, Alexis Javier, Erik Hoverston, and Benicio Lopez at edX/UC Berkeley Full-Stack Bootcamp for conceptual and coding assistance in addition to instruction. I also got some help from the edX Xpert Learning Assistance AI. Thanks to classmates Dawson Dohlen, Tina Rahimian and Kun Wansom for discussions around mongoose and JSX. Conversations with An Sung-min, Art Camacho and Tala Awwad also contributed to my understanding of the concepts.
